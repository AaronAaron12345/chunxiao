您好，
我将latex格式的内容转移到了word文档中，并对其格式进行了大概的整理，上次您给我的建议我还没有修改，仅仅是将latex编辑器转移成了word编辑器，方便之后的发表。
代码我统一打包到了HyperNetFusion.zip里，在实验过程中由于使用了11个数据集，所以实验的代码很多，但是我都没有放进来，我只将我的整个模型部分的代码，和用于跑我们癌症数据集的代码放进来了，如果需要实验时跑其他数据集的代码作为佐证，您告诉我，我之后继续进行梳理。
pdf文件是上一次版本的内容，我担心在变成word过程中会有什么疏漏，也放了进来方便word对您造成困扰时可以与pdf进行对照。
如果有什么疑问或者还需要我提供什么，您可以随时告知我，我将尽我可能快速的回复您，争取在您的帮助下早日发表。

以上是我写给导师的回信，请你重新组织语音使其逻辑清晰



Dear Professor,

I hope this message finds you well!

I have transferred the content from LaTeX format into a Word document and made some preliminary adjustments to the formatting. Regarding the suggestions you provided last time, I have not yet made the changes, as I have only transferred the content from the LaTeX editor to the Word editor for easier submission in the future.

During the experiment, due to the involvement of 11 datasets, there is quite a bit of code. I have only included the code for my model and the code used to run our cancer dataset in the HyperNetFusion.zip file, and I did not include the code for the other datasets. If you need these additional datasets' code as supporting evidence, please let me know, and I will continue to organize and provide it.

Additionally, I have attached the PDF file of the previous version for reference. I am concerned that there may be some discrepancies during the conversion to Word, so I included the PDF version to avoid any formatting issues with the Word document.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I will do my best to respond promptly and hope to complete the submission with your help as soon as possible.

Thank you for your continued support and guidance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
